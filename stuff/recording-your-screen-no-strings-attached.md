title: Recording your screen on Linux, no strings attached
---
# {{ page.title }}

You may have seen around the internet websites like openscreenrecorder, which isn't open and costs money if you want to record for more than ten minutes.  But today, I'm going to show you a way to record your screen WITHOUT money changing hands.  
   
Before you shout ***OBS*** I want to say that OBS doesn't run on some computers and this ran on an ASUS Transformer T100. Which is sloooooow. ***SO SLOW***.

The program? Simple Screen Recorder.

Install from the AUR with `yay -Sy simplescreenrecorder` and bask in the glory of free video recording. Enjoy.
