		Repos that are interesting:
		<ul>
			<li><a href=https://github.com/ManimCommunity/Manim>Manim</a><br>Python animation library, written and used by <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw>3Blue1Brown</a> (community-maintained version listed here, 3b1b's original repo not recommended for general use).</li>
			<li><a href=https://github.com/starship/starship>Starship</a><br>Cross-shell (bash, zsh, fish, ion) prompt written in Rust. Cross between Pure and Spaceship.</li>

			<li><a href=https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono>JetBrains Mono</a><br>Open source font for programming, comes with loads of ligatures like != and more (the greater/less than or equal to clashes with HTML, otherwise I'd've put them here).
		</ul>
